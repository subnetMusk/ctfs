'''
Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a network protocol that uses cryptography to
establish a secure channel over an insecure network (i.e. the internet).

SSH enables developers and system administrators to run commands on servers from
the other side of the world, without their password being sniffed or data being
stolen. It is therefore critical to the security of the web.

In the old days, system administrators used to logon to their servers using telnet.
This works similarly to our interactive challenges that involve connecting to
socket.cryptohack.org - data is sent to a remote server, which performs actions
based on what is sent. There is no transport encryption, so anyone listening in on
the network (such as the WiFi access point owner, your ISP, or the NSA) can see all
the telnet traffic.

As the internet became increasingly hostile, people realised the need for both
authentication and encryption for administrative network traffic. SSH, first
released in 1995, achieves these goals and much more, with advanced functionality
built into the software like port forwarding, X11 forwarding, and
SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).

SSH uses a client-server architecture, meaning the server runs SSH as a service
daemon which is always online and waiting to receive connections, and the user
runs an SSH client to make a connection to it.

Most commonly, SSH is configured to use public-private key pairs for authentication.
On the server, a copy of the user's public key is stored.
The user's private key is stored locally on their laptop.

Now let's say Bruce wants to connect as his user account bschneier to his server
bruces-server. From his laptop he runs ssh bschneier@bruces-server.
His SSH client opens a connection to the server on port 22 where the SSH daemon
listens. First, the ciphers that will be used are agreed upon, then a session key
to encrypt the connection is established using Diffie-Hellman Key exchange,
but we won't go into the details on that here. Then, the server sends a random
challenge message encrypted with Bruce's public key.
Bruce uses his private key to decrypt the challenge and send a hash of the
random challenge message back, proving that he owns the correct private key and
he therefore authenticates himself to the server as bschneier.

Now, the server gives Bruce a shell to run commands.
If public-private key cryptography doesn't make sense to you yet, don't worry -
we'll cover it extensively in the RSA category.

An SSH private key is stored in the PEM format, which we discussed in the
"Privacy-Enhanced Mail" challenge. So it looks like this and is stored on
Bruce's laptop at /home/bschneier/.ssh/id_rsa:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIBCgKC... (a whole bunch of base64)
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

SSH public keys, however, use a different format:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQCtPLqba+GFvDHdFVs1Vvdk56cKqqw5cdomlu
034666UsoFIqkig8H5kNsNefSpaR/iU7G0ZKCiWRRuAbTsuHN+Cz526XhQvzgKTBkTGYXdF/WdG/

U3S3j92qc27BVGChpQiGwjjut4CkHauzQA/gKCBIiLyzoFcLEHhjOBOEErnvrRPWCIAJhALkwV2r

t1Ue/ZW7TlPRYzAoIB62C0= bschneier@facts

This format makes it easier for these public keys to be added as lines to the
file /home/bschneier/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server. Adding the public key
to this file allows the corresponding private key to be used to authenticate
on the server.

The ssh-keygen command is used to produce these public-private keypairs.

Extract the modulus n as a decimal integer from Bruce's SSH public key.
