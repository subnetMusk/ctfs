When you connect to a website over HTTPS, the first TLS message sent by the server
is the ServerHello containing the server TLS certificate.

Your browser verifies that the TLS certificate is valid, and if not, will terminate
the TLS handshake. Verification includes ensuring that:
    - the name on the certificate matches the domain
    - the certificate has not expired
    - the certificate is ultimately signed (via a "chain of trust") by a root key of
        a Certificate Authority (CA) that's trusted by your browser or operating
        system



Since CAs have the power to sign any certificate, the security of the internet depends
upon these organisations to issue TLS certificates to the correct people: they must
only issue certificates to the real domain owners.

However with Windows trusting root certificates from over 100 organisations by default,
there's a number of opportunities for hackers, politics, or incompetence to break the
whole model. If you could trick just a single CA to issue you a certificate for
microsoft.com, you could use the corresponding private key to sign malware and bypass
trust controls on Windows.

CAs are strongly incentivised to be careful since their business depends upon people
trusting them, however in practice they have failed several times.

In 2011 Comodo CA was compromised and the hacker was able to issue certificates for
Gmail and other services.

In 2016, Symantec was found to have issued over 150 certificates without the domain
owner's knowledge, as well as 2400 certificates for domains that were never registered.

Due to such events, together with the fact that fraudulent certificates can take a
long time to be discovered, since 2018 Certificate Transparency has been enforced
by Google Chrome.

Every CA must publish all certificates that they issue to a log, which anyone can search.

Attached is an RSA public key in PEM format.

Find the subdomain of cryptohack.org which uses these parameters in its TLS
certificate, and visit that subdomain to obtain the flag.
