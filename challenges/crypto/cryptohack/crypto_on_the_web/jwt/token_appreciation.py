JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) is a framework specifying ways to
securely transmit information on the Internet.

It's most well-known for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are used to authorise yourself
on a website or application. JWTs typically do this by storing your "login session"
in your browser after you have authenticated yourself by entering your username and
password.

In other words, the website gives you a JWT that contains your user ID, and can be
presented to the site to prove who you are without logging in again.
JWTs look like this:
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJmbGFnIjoiY3J5cHRve2p3dF9jb250ZW50c19jYW5f
YmVfZWFzaWx5X3ZpZXdlZH0iLCJ1c2VyIjoiQ3J5cHRvIE1jSGFjayIsImV4cCI6MjAwNTAzMzQ5M30.s

You can recognise it because it's base64-encoded data split into three parts
(separated by a .): the header, the payload, and the signature. In fact, it's a
variant of base64 encoding, where the + and / have been replaced by different special
characters since they can cause issues in URLs.

Some developers believe that the JWT encoding is like encryption, so they put
sensitive data inside the tokens. To prove them wrong, decode the JWT above to
find the flag. There are online tools to do this quickly, but working with Python's
PyJWT library will prepare you best for future challenges.
